My bytebeat projects

I don't have a clean way to actually play these on their own so you will have to copy the contents of whichever js file you wish to play then paste them into a bytebeat interpereter.
such as this one: https://greggman.com/downloads/examples/html5bytebeat/html5bytebeat.html#t=0&e=0&s=44100&bb=5d000001000100000000000000001841fbffffffe0000000
